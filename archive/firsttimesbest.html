First time's best 
(February)
<p>
Snowdrops popped up under the neighbor's tree<br> 
I think<br>
We can steal a few<br>
put them in our garden out front<br>
it's not ours, it's rented<br>
but it is infront of us, nonetheless<br>
Good idea.<br>

Rain comes down. "welcome to England"<br>
I've never written beside you before<br>
a few things unprecedented<br>
for 2021<br>
to say the least<br>
</p>
<p>
One month ago the blonde mop said<br> 
we are locking in, locking down<br>
for a third time<br>
and this will be a long haul<br>
It took me time, I admit, to feel it<br>
higher peaks, lower lows<br>
suddenly a smaller pendulum<br>
there is joy, still, in days together<br>
let's grind some coffee, and<br>
feel them move out of time<br>
</p>
<p>
Will you let the quiet in<br>
it feels like death, so no<br>
but it's just there, waiting<br>
had I been chasing whatever dreams, i didn't even know<br>
years and years, great band<br>
to unlearn it now?<br>
when the most important part of life has been ordered<br>
</div>
<div>
halt<br>

<p>
You said, "do you miss Canada?"<br>
I said my friends and family<br>
It's hard to be away<br>
now a weight felt by more, I suppose<br>
slowed days have made<br>
my bustling feel silly<br>
acclimatized patterns, fizzle<br>
time of day for this, for that<br>
tit for tat<br>
</p>
<p>
I wonder, where were they even born? The answer<br>
"under pressure"<br>
